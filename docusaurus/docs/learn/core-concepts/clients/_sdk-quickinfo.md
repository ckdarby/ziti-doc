If you are building a new application you have a unique opportunity to choose to use one of the Ziti SDKs and to create a
truly zero trust application from the start! A Ziti Edge SDK enables your application to discover and provide or connect to Ziti services directly without an agent or proxy. The SDKs use [the Edge Client API](../../../reference/api/index.md#edge-client-api) provided by the controller to authenticate and discover routers and services. Then, the SDK connects to the most responsive router and begins hosting or connecting to the Ziti service.
