# Ziti Controlller REST API

The API version and Swagger definition for a particular controller may be fetched and there are relatively good documents
available as well, also served directly from the controller. There are two main endpoints 

## Client API

The client api services are used by endpoints to interact with the [Ziti Network](../../overview#overview-of-a-ziti-network).
These services are necessary to authenticate, enroll, return services and fetch other information related to the 
endpoint's participating in the network.

### Download the Client API Spec

The client api spec can be downloaded from your controller at the following url (replace "${CONTROLLER_URL}" accordingly)
[https://${CONTROLLER_URL}/edge/client/v1/docs](https://${CONTROLLER_URL}/edge/client/v1/docs).

## Management API

The management api is used to configure, manage, and maintain the [Ziti Network](../../overview#overview-of-a-ziti-network).

### Download the Management API Spec

The client api spec can be downloaded from your controller at the following url (replace "${CONTROLLER_URL}" accordingly)
[https://${CONTROLLER_URL}/edge/management/v1/docs](https://${CONTROLLER_URL}/edge/management/v1/docs).
