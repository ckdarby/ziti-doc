# API Documentation

Here you will find the information necessary to successfully use a Ziti SDK to create an application. If there is a term
which is not familiar please refer to the [glossary](../glossary/).

Each SDK has certain syntax unique to the particular language the SDK is targeting. Each SDK presents an api which is
as idiomatic as possible to present a consistent look and feel for the language or runtime being used.
