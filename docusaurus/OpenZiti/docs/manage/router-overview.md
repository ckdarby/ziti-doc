# Ziti Router

A Ziti Router is a process that is installed on a host which allows it to participate in a Ziti network.  There are two
types of routers: edge routers and fabric routers.

At this time edge routers are available for use with a [Ziti Network](/ziti/overview.md#overview-of-a-ziti-network). See
the [Ziti Network Quickstart](/ziti/quickstarts/quickstart-overview.md) for details about how to create your network.
